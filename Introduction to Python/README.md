Hi, welcome to introduction to python. This notebook is not a tutorial but a sort of refrence book. It mostly contains correct & official resources you should refer to when learning. We recommend you go through jupyter yourself. if you encounter some problem, or have some queries we will be glad to help you - you can contact us on BCS's discord server. 

Kindly read the markdown written in the notebook carefully, the notebook can be very overwhelming if you are a beginner so i recommend you take things slowly and google a lot. The notebook can be downloaded on your local machine just make sure you have correct environment setup and right libraries installed. If you are new to this, dont worry the notebook briefly covers it too...(you know where to find us)

happy learning !!!
